# Visitor Motivation Survey for Google Tag Manager

This branch contains a version of the VMS JavaScript file that was customized by Tushar Samant of the Chicago Architecture Foundation. He said:

> The code had to be changed to take Google Tag Manager into account. Many of the changes in this branch are just to fit with our general JS environment (register "init" function, use $.cookie to manipulate cookies, use window.ga since ga by itself is not in scope, etc). The sendMotivation function has the real Tag Manager change.
